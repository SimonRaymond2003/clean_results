<p>title: “Writing” output: html_document date: “2025-02-25” —</p>
<div id="hook-and-context" class="section level1">
<h1>hook and context</h1>
<p>The NFL is a multi-billion dollar industry that has seen rapid growth
within the American and International. This growth has placed more and
more importance on the performance of NFL teams as they fight to win
games to increase the popularity of their team as Davis and End (2010)
argue that successful NFL franchises have measurable economic impacts on
their local areas. This revelation has given rise to a age of data
analytics in the NFL as teams seek to gain competitive advantages over
their rivals. This had led GMs and coaches to explore different avenues
of strategies.</p>
<p>For many years in the NFL there seemed to be a consistent standard
that when faced with a fourth down your team will kick a field goal or
punt the ball for better field position. The only exception being the
dying moments in a game when teams are desperate for a miracle. Many
diverse data display tools have let us see an increase in the overall
attempt percentage of teams on fourth down (Raymond, 2024). This is
signalling a change in culture.</p>
<p>In the NFL teams are realizing a need to be more aggressive on fourth
downs. We have seen teams adopt this strategy. Most famously are the
Detroit Lions. Since the arrival of their current head coach Dan
Campbell, the lions adopted a aggressive strategy to match their
aggressive “biting off knee caps” mentality (Birkett, 2023). While the
lions have seen success for the first time in years, they have also been
criticized for their aggressive play calling. This was highlighted in
the 2023-24 playoff divisional round game in which the Lions failed a
fourth down attempt that was painted as unnecessary (Sporting News,
2024). After this mid-game failure there seemed to be a shift in
momentum and the lions lost the game</p>
</div>
<div id="research-problem" class="section level1">
<h1>research problem</h1>
<p>A result like this causes one ask the question “Did the Lions make
the right call?”. This question seems to be getting answered as “yes” by
the current literature. However, we need to know if different teams
should “go-for-it” or not “go-for-it” depending on their situation and
team make up. For example, it could be argued that the lions should have
attempted the crucial fourth down in the 2023-24 playoff divisional
round game. However, if the Panthers (which were a significantly worse
team) were is that situation it could be argued that they should not
have been as aggressive. This is because the panthers could have had a
worse chance of being able to convert on fourth down.</p>
<p>On top of this, we must be weary of any recommendation that is given
to a head coach. The truth is that we are not on the field, in the
locker rooms, or in team meeting. This means coaches may know more then
us in certain game time decision. We must approach this topic with the
idea of being more practical and clear to coaches. If we are simply
pointing our algorithms and giving black-box predictions we lose all
credibility as one would be oblivous to the true depth of decision
making in the NFL.</p>
</div>
<div id="research-question" class="section level1">
<h1>research question</h1>
<p>This leads us to have a need to answer some key questions about
fourth downs in the NFL. First, is are there certain key predictable
signals that can be used to decide if a given team should attempt a
fourth down? Second, is what key variables about players have predictive
power in fourth down attempts? In other words, are there players that
are more important in fourth down situations when compared to other
situations. Finally, do these key variables about players have a causal
effect on the outcome of fourth down attempts? Answering these questions
will allow coaches to look for key signals in fourth down situations and
to know which players to start on that fourth down if it is decided to
attempt. This also can be applied in discovering specialty players that
are overlooked due to poor performances in situations that are not
similar to fourth down.</p>
</div>
<div id="liturature-review" class="section level1">
<h1>liturature review</h1>
<p>Much discourse revolves around the idea that NFL coaches are acting
overly averse to risk, which is lowering their expected wins. Romer
(2006) found that teams had begun to move towards a more conservative or
safe strategy in the NFL. He argues that teams value successful gambles
more then the expected win percentage in a game. He theorizes that the
poor decision making is either due to risk aversion or it is due to poor
information.</p>
<p>To further this point using matching analysis, Yam and Lopez (2018)
quantified this conservative decision-making, finding that teams could
gain approximately 0.4 wins per year by being more aggressive on fourth
downs.</p>
<p>Goff and Locke (2019) found when revisiting Romer’s framework that
Romer’s core findings are still held to be true. However, they argue
that overly conservative calls are not due to poor decision making.
Instead they point to risk aversion as they estimate that coaches are
willing to give up two-thirds of a expected point to avoid the
uncertainty of fourth down attempts.</p>
<p>On top of this, there seems to be evidence that coaches are more
cautious when their job is on the line. Owens and Roach (2018) found
that in the NCAA coaches are relatively more conservative when they are
more likely to be fired. At the same time they found when a coach was
likely to be promoted they behave more aggressive then normal.</p>
<p>If a team feels to be “on fire” should they be more aggressive since
they feel they have momentum? A important area of literature is the
fallacy of the “hot hand”. The hot hand is a cognitive bias that leads
people to believe that a person who has a successful outcome is more
likely to have a successful outcome in future attempts. Gilovich et
al. (1985) investigated the “hot hand” and “shooting streaks” in
basketball. They found that both players and fans believed in the
fallacy despite shots being independent of each other. Losak et
al. (2023) similarly discovered that fantasy baseball users gravitated
towards “hot” players. At the same time they were unable to identify a
viable hot hand strategy in DraftKings DFS baseball.</p>
<p>Despite these common findings in other sports there does seem to be
some evidence of momentum existing in the NFL. Roebber et al.(2022,
p. 2) defined momentum in the NFL as “the sustained increase in win
probability by a single team over the course of at least 2 successive
changes in possession”. With this definition, they found that streaks of
win probability in football are non-random and are in fact predictable
with Artificial Neural Network Models.</p>
<p>Lehman &amp; Hahn (2013) looked to identify momentum across and
within games in the NFL. Within-period momentum was found to encourage
teams to take more risks. Negative within-period momentum was in turn
found to encourage teams to take less risks. It was also discovered that
across-period momentum has an effect only until a within-period momentum
was established in a game</p>
</div>
<div id="gap-in-the-research" class="section level1">
<h1>gap in the research</h1>
<p>The gap in the current research revolves around the lack in quality
data. Currently we observe many studies include team-aggregated grades
or summary statistics about teams that are playing against each other.
This type of generalization is needed for econometric models that cannot
handle large amounts of variables. However, our non-parametric models
will be able to handle data with thousands of different variables. To
take advantage of this, we will have information about every single
player that is on the field when the ball is snapped. This will allow us
to have better prediction power then previous researchers. These
non-parametric models will also allow us to discover key player specific
variables that can allow for further causal inference with specific
on-field positions. We hope to find how different player and non-player
variables impact the conversion of fourth down attempts.</p>

<div id="exogenous-variables" class="section level1">
<h1>exogenous variables</h1>
<p>In our sample selection correction model a validation of the
exogeniety of our variables that are used to predict whether or not a
fourth down is attempted. While we can use theory to prove that these
variables are exogenous to 4th down conversions, it is also possible to
empirically prove this. Our situation is unique as 3rd downs can be used
as a proxy of 4th downs with little to no self selection bias. This is
due to how certain conditions cause a 3rd down to be treated similarly
to a 4th down by the coaches. A fourth down is a teams last attempt for
that offensive drive. While not in all, there are many cases of third
down provide the similar conditions in terms of the coaches decision
making.</p>
<p>In the proof of this we can first note that the grades of a teams
kicker is positivly significant in it’s effect on fourth downs. This
lets us proceed to prove the exogeniety of kicker grades on the
conversion of a fourth down. From a theoretical side we can reason that
the kicker is not on the field during a fourth down and also is unable
to effect the decision making of the coaches, as there are no further
decisions to be made. In a third down we actually find that kicker
grades do have positive significance on the conversion of a third down.
While this sets off alarm bells it is quickly visible that this
significance is only found in the middle of the field, where the kicker
is more likely to be used if the third down is not converted. This
highlights that when the kicker is not apart of the decision making
process on third down, similarly to fourth down, it does not have a
effect on 3rd down conversion. This allows us the luxury of having
empirical proof of the exogeniety of our kicker grades on the conversion
of fourth downs.</p>
<p>Our second key exogenous variable stems from the score differential
of the team with possession of the football. This variable ranges from
-30 to +30 where -30 means a team is losing by 30 points and vice versa.
The interpretion of its effect or lack of effect on the attempt and
conversion of fourth downs is tricky due to non linearity. To start it
is broken down into differnt variables and interactions with a tie game
being the base case (score differential = 0).</p>
<ul>
<li>is_winning - Binary</li>
<li>is_losing - Binary</li>
<li>winning_score_diff - Continuous with a range of 1 to 30.</li>
<li>losing_score_diff - Continuous with a range of -30 to -1.</li>

<p>better kicker, trust kicker, you are fie to kick it. so 3rd down is
convert or dont convert… you are fine kicking on 4th down so you HAVE to
get it her ein third</p>
<p>worse kicker, dont trust kicker, you are not fine to kick it. so 3rd
down is convert or dont convert… you are not fine kicking on 4th down.
so you lan to go for it on 4th… so you are fine with running it and not
getting the first down on third down and then getting it on 4th
down.</p>
