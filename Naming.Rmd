## Coach Fixed Effects
- These are binary variables representing each NFL head coach (like Chuck_Pagano, Bruce_Arians, Sean_McDermott, etc.). Each coach has a coefficient in the model that represents their individual tendency or propensity toward certain fourth down decisions.

## Team/Season Fixed Effects
- These are binary variables that represent specific team-season combinations (like year2017_team_ARI, year2018_team_DAL, etc.). Each variable controls for team-specific and season-specific effects that remain constant across all games for that team in that season.
